 ## Info About Me 
 Hello my name is valantino and i am an aspiring game and web developer i enjoy a lot of physical activity sports such as soccer and also like non phisical activity such as gaming and content creating.why i have decided to choose the path of information technology is because when i was in high school  i noticed that i really enjoyed using and playing with tech and from that it led me to chose multimedia as one of my core subjects and from their learned to use software's like photoshop, after effects, adobe illustrator and Dreamweaver. Now i have decided to take the next step in my learning journey through RMIT a university known for I.T. and fair prices. 
 ### Jobs 
 Some of the roles i feel that i would be suited for are roles such as Software Engineer Game director or Web Developer because i am passionate about video games and coming up with new ideas of what developers should do to improve on them so stepping in the roll of a Game director will come with a lot of pressure but its pressure i believe i'd be able to handle beacsue i have learned to have a decent control over my emotions so that they don'y cloud my judgement.

## Project Idea's 


### Project 1 Video Game 
Project, I have been really keen on working on is a video game. This Specific game I would like to be an open world adventure game that is set in 1518 Feudal Japan action packed to keep the player engaged at all times. It will incorporate a mix of real and fictional character’s that were alive at the time and a challenging combat system that forces you to use all the different types of weapons that will be available to you. As the player you get to decide between the types of groups you join or leave. During the story you get to decide to take the road of being a Samurai warrior that will do anything for his honor and shogun-Master a Ninja an assassin for hire or a bandit. With each route you take you combat style changes and so do your weapons of choice for example if you decide you want to be a ninja you will have to learn all the different types of weapons that come with being a ninja and knowing where and when to use them you can also customize your clothing and weapons to suit your personality and stand out from the crowd or take the stealthy approach wearing costumes to look like a priest farmer or merchant.  
### The open world 
The world will include different types of landscapes that will all have their unique weather system so depending on the region you are in it can either be sunny raining or snowing. With the change of the weather, it can be also an advantage or disadvantage for example in the snow you can use it to mask your approach on your targets and enemies but if you are swimming in such a climate it can quickly take a toll on your health bar. 
### Combat System 
In the Combat system you get to choose between different fighting styles to suit your character in the game you have a choice of 3 and as you develop and get better at the game you can upgrade and even start to branch out and take moves from other styles to become a better all-round player in general and incorporating that with weapons as well. 
### The Main Story 
In the main story you will play as Toshimi an orphan who was born in a small village who parents abandoned at a young age and had to steal just to get a decent meal to keep him going for the rest of the day. Eventually wounded up in a foster home the only place where he-she could call home and sadly that all came crashing down when the village was raided by a neighboring clan which resulted in the death of his/her foster parents after this tragic event occurs it sparks a chain of events that results in you having to take up the roll of being a hero or antihero to make sure that justice is served to the men and the leader/shogun who ordered the massacre of your village. 

### Project 2 Website  
My second project I would like to work on is creating a website where I can sell merchandise and gaming accessories being a content creator, I would like to have my own website that people can visit and read about me see any upcoming event like giveaways or livestreams or if they would like to support me by buying my merch. I will also consistently update or change the layout depending on the response from my audience or things like certain holidays Example Christmas holloween Easter. 
### Why a Video Game 
The reason why I think this video game will be a success is because more and more gamers are getting are starting to appreciate games like this a good example is Assassin’s Creed Valhalla which sold over 150 million units the most the instalments ever seen in its 13 years and with the release of ghost of Tsushima the gaming community is itching for another game set in Japan. I have always been a believer in that you should decide which path you want to take and what choices you want to make that affect the story so you can have different outcomes and know that you weren’t forced into anything. 
### Whats Needed For My Projects 
For the website I will be using adobe dreamweaver because its very user friendly and its what I prefer but a good alternative is also wix which allows you to simply drag and drop and choose from ready made website themes and decide what you want to customize add delete as for dreamweaver it will force you to learn coding language to a certain extent. For the video game its going to be a massive project so its going to take an entire team and with a game of this caliber a lot of talented coders actors 3D artist actors and a very big budget which could often discourage 1 person but if such a product was to be done and released to the public the gap between the profits compared to the budget will  be a significant margin that will leave investors and your entire team set.
