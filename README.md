 ## About Me 
 Hello my name is valantino and i am an aspiring game and web developer i enjoy a lot of physical activity sports such as soccer and also like non phisical activity such as gaming and content creating.why i have decided to choose the path of information technology is because when i was in high school  i noticed that i really enjoyed using and playing with tech and from that it led me to chose multimedia as one of my core subjects and from their learned to use software's like photoshop, after effects, adobe illustrator and Dreamweaver. Now i have decided to take the next step in my learning journey through RMIT a university known for I.T. and fair prices.
