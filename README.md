## Project Idea's 


### Project 1 Video Game 
Project, I have been really keen on working on is a video game. This Specific game I would like to be an open world adventure game that is set in 1518 Feudal Japan action packed to keep the player engaged at all times. It will incorporate a mix of real and fictional characterâ€™s that were alive at the time and a challenging combat system that forces you to use all the different types of weapons that will be available to you. As the player you get to decide between the types of groups you join or leave. During the story you get to decide to take the road of being a Samurai warrior that will do anything for his honor and shogun-Master a Ninja an assassin for hire or a bandit. With each route you take you combat style changes and so do your weapons of choice for example if you decide you want to be a ninja you will have to learn all the different types of weapons that come with being a ninja and knowing where and when to use them you can also customize your clothing and weapons to suit your personality and stand out from the crowd or take the stealthy approach wearing costumes to look like a priest farmer or merchant.  
### The open world 
The world will include different types of landscapes that will all have their unique weather system so depending on the region you are in it can either be sunny raining or snowing. With the change of the weather, it can be also an advantage or disadvantage for example in the snow you can use it to mask your approach on your targets and enemies but if you are swimming in such a climate it can quickly take a toll on your health bar. 
### Combat System 
In the Combat system you get to choose between different fighting styles to suit your character in the game you have a choice of 3 and as you develop and get better at the game you can upgrade and even start to branch out and take moves from other styles to become a better all-round player in general and incorporating that with weapons as well. 
### The Main Story 
In the main story you will play as Toshimi an orphan who was born in a small village who parents abandoned at a young age and had to steal just to get a decent meal to keep him going for the rest of the day. Eventually wounded up in a foster home the only place where he-she could call home and sadly that all came crashing down when the village was raided by a neighboring clan which resulted in the death of his/her foster parents after this tragic event occurs it sparks a chain of events that results in you having to take up the roll of being a hero or antihero to make sure that justice is served to the men and the leader/shogun who ordered the massacre of your village.
